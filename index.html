                <h5>What is extract.pics?</h5>
                <p>Extract.pics is an easy to use tool that allows you to extract, view and download images from any public website. Simply paste the URL of the website into the input field and click "Extract" to start the process. After a few seconds you will see most or even all of the images found on the website.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h5>How can I find specific images?</h5>
                <p>You can view the found images in a grid or list and explore them by sorting them by name, type, dimensions, width, height or the actual file size. Additionally you can search for images by their name, size or type/file format. This makes it really easy to find exactly the images you need.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h5>What other tools are available?</h5>
                <p>In case some images are very bright, you can switch to a dark background to make them more visible. You can use the copy the URL of one or more images by clicking the link icon or the Copy selected URLs button. You can also very easily download indiviual images or multiple images at once by selecting them and then downloading them all in a ZIP archive.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h5>Is it free?</h5>
                <p>Yes, extract.pics is free to use without creating an account!
                    There is an hourly and daily limit on the number of extractions you can run to prevent abuse. However, you can extend these limits by creating an account or subscribing to a premium plan.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h5>How can I download images?</h5>
                <p>After the extraction process is finished you will find a list of all the images found on the website you entered. You can then use the  button to download individual images.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h5>Can I download multiple images at once?</h5>
                <p>Of course, you can select them by clicking the images and the use the "Download selected" button on the left to download all selected images in a ZIP file. This can take some time depending on how many images you selected. Note that there is a chance that some images cannot be downloaded and won't be included in the ZIP file.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h5>The extraction does not work. Why?</h5>
                <p>There are several reasons why the extraction might fail. The website you entered might be not be publicly accessible or it might be protected by a login. Very slow or large websites might also cause issues.</p>
                <p>And sometimes there are a lot of people using extract.pics at the same time which can cause performance issues on our side. In this case you should try again later or try a different website. We are continuously working on improving the performance of our service.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h5>The download does not work. Why?</h5>
                <p>Sometimes other websites block the download of images from their website. In this case you can right-click the images and press "Save image as..." or try to open the image in a new tab and download it from there.</p>
                <p>When trying to download multiple images at once, some images might not be included in the ZIP file, because they could not be downloaded. In this case you can try to download them individually. If the download does not work at all, please contact us.</p>

        <div class="row mb-5">
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h5>How does it work?</h5>
                <p>Everytime you start the extraction process the website you entered is openend in a Google Chrome browser. We then apply multiple different methods to find all the images (and even SVG elements) on the website. After that the images are analyzed to show useful information like type, name and size.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h5>Does it work with dynamic websites?</h5>
                <p>Yes. Every website is viewed just like you view them in your browser. We use the latest version of the Google Chrome browser to process the websites you provide. After loading your website we execute JavaScript and wait for any requests to finish before starting the extraction process.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h5>How many images are extracted?</h5>
                <p>After the server navigates to the website you provided, it scrolls down really fast for a few seconds to find as many images as possible. Every image that the website loads in those first ~10 seconds is then sent back to you. Tracking pixels and missing or invalid images are automatically removed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h5>What does "Image preview not available" mean?</h5>
                <p>This can have several reasons. The most common is that the webserver, the image is stored on, does not allow the image to be loaded/shown on other websites. If that is the case, we cannot display the image on the page. However, it is very likely that you are still able to download the image. If that fails too, try to open the image in a new tab.</p>
